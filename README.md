In our project we have simulated two models to demonstrate the transient stability of a system, one a single machine infinite bus system and second a multi-machine 9 bus system.
A system becomes unstable when the electrical power input fed to the motor is less than the mechanical load. So, the excess power required is supplied by the stored energy in the rotating system. As a result, the motor oscillates around the equilibrium and ends up coming to rest or to lose synchronism.

The simulation of the single machine system is given in PSA_mod1.slx.
The simulation of the single machine system is given in PSA_final.slx.
The report and the simulation guide is given is PSA_report.
